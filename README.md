# Awesome Genome Browsers

This repo is for keeping track of genome browsers and genomic visualization tools. The initial list is taken from [twitter replies](https://twitter.com/David_McGaughey/status/1122878399159119872), Google-ing, and my memory.

I'd love pull requests!

## Reactive Genome Browsers (web)
Tool | Manuscript | Comments
---  | ---- | ----
[igv.js](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js/) | - | JavaScript based tools from the IGV team. Super easy to get started. A bit barebones in functionality for track picking and plotting. Actively developed (as of April 2019)
[jbrowse](https://jbrowse.org) | [Genome Biology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072794) | JavaScript / HTML5 tool. Actively developed (as of April 2019). They also have a Electron desktop tool. Good looking docs, tons of features. 
[higlass](http://higlass.io) | [Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1486-1) | D3.js based 2D (Hi-C) and 1D genome browser. Can handle hundreds of tracks. Actively developed (as of April 2019). Docker app for deployment. 
[GIVE](https://www.givengine.org) | [Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1465-6) | 1D browser with some "2D" (Hi-C) data functionality. Docker install option.

[IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) | [Briefings in Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/14/2/178/208453/Integrative-Genomics-Viewer-IGV-high-performance?searchresult=1) | The benchmark for desktop tools.
